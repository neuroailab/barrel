Brains do remarkable work in actively analyzing environmental information and making decisions based on this information. Among all brain systems, sensory systems are especially concentrated on analyzing some particular environmental information, e.g., light for visual systems, sound for auditory systems, and inputs from whiskers for the rodent somatosensory systems~\cite{purves2001neuroscience}.
The goal of these sensory systems is to extract behaviorally useful information from the complex raw input data, a process which could be described as untangling the behavior-related dimensions (such as category) from other orthogonal dimensions (such as translation and rotation of the objects)~\cite{yamins2016using}.
While these systems radically differ in their input modalities, number of overall neurons, and specific neuronal microcircuits, most of them share two fundamental characteristics. First, they are deep sensory cascades, consisting of sequences of brain areas (cortical and subcortical), each of which alone is comparatively simple, but which together produce a complex transformation of the input data. Second most of them are inherently spatially extended~\cite{felleman1991distributed}.
In this paper, we will propose a method to give a computational model for the rodent somatosensory systems based on the hierarchical structure and the function of untangling.

Similar to the ventral stream of visual systems with hierarchical structures from V1, to V2, V4, and IT~\cite{felleman1991distributed, Goodale1992}, researchers have found evidence showing hierarchical processing for somatosensory input in rodents, human, and primates\cite{Pons1987, Inui2004, Iwamura1998}. For example, the second somatosensory area (S2) is found to rely on inputs from S1 (first somatosensory area) \cite{Pons1987, Petersen2007}. And barrel cortex, S1, and S2 are also found to get different aspects of input from rodent whiskers \cite{Diamond2008}. Meanwhile connections between barrel cortex and S1, S1 and S2 are also believed to convey information for hierarchical processing \cite{Petersen2007}. However, while barrel cortex is already explored a lot, the functions of both S1 and S2 is poorly understood.

In this work, we will use hierarchical models for rodent somatosensory systems as a computational model that correctly describes neural responses as a function of stimulus input. 
Hierarchical models are also used widely in artificial intelligence to help design better systems for various tasks. Recent work using deep neural networks (DNNs) has achieved significant improvements on object recognition, speech recognition, and numerous other artificial intelligence tasks\cite{Krizhevsky, hinton2012deep, lecun2015deep}. 
These deep neural networks are all composed of multiple simple neural network layers in series, where the computation in single layer is usually simple but non-linear and stacks of those simple non-linear computations make up a highly complicated non-linear computation. 
DNNs are also believed to be biologically plausible, and therefore could be good candidates for models of sensory cortical brain systems.

In fact, researchers have also found that the DNNs optimized for performances on object recognition tasks serve as a good model for the primate ventral visual stream \cite{Yamins2013, Yamins2014, Cadieu2014}. 
Using a general class of computational architectures known as HCNNs \cite{lecun1995convolutional}, which also include the recent convolutional neural networks, they found that optimizing for object recognition task could improve not only the performances on explaining the responses of IT layers using that of final layers but also that of explaining V4 areas using intermediate layers of the same architecture simultaneously \cite{Cadieu2014}.
And the final models they got successfully surpassed all existed models on explaining IT and V4 areas. Similar results were also found in the deep neural networks that were trained on large-scale object recognition tasks \cite{Yamins2014}.
