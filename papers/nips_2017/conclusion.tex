The dataset we created was meant to sustain a highly variable object shape recognition task for use in training the neural networks.  

It is likely that the choice of the tasks is believed to be critical for whether the trained networks will be a good model for that cortex or not.
For example, it has been shown that one of the important reasons that the neural networks trained for object recognition could predict responses of IT cortex in visual cortex well~\cite{Yamins2014, cadieu2014deep} is that object recognition is believed to be a major function performed by IT cortex~\cite{hung2005fast, yamins2016using}. 

Although the functions performed by rodent somatosensory systems are poorly understood, it is found that rodents could use their whiskers to detect object shape, position, and texture of object surface\cite{Boubenec2012,Diamond2008,Arabzadeh2005,OConnor2010}.
Therefore, we are temporarily using object recognition as the task to generate the dataset and optimize the neural networks. But meanwhile, we also make other information such as object shapes as surface normals and speed of object moving available for further task switching.
